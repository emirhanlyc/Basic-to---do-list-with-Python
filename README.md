📝 To-Do List Application
Python · Tkinter · ttkbootstrap

This project is a simple, modern, and functional To-Do List application built using Python’s Tkinter library and the ttkbootstrap theme. It is designed to help users easily organize, mark, and reorder their daily tasks.

🚀 Features:
✔️ Add new tasks
🗑️ Delete tasks (with confirmation)
🔼 Move tasks up
🔽 Move tasks down
💾 Save tasks to a file
🔄 Automatically load tasks on startup
⌨️ Add tasks quickly using the Enter key

📂 File Logic
Your tasks are preserved even if the application is closed.
All tasks are stored in the gorevler.txt file located in the same directory.
New task → Added to the end of the file
Deleting or moving tasks → The file is rewritten from scratch
On app startup → All tasks are reloaded from the file

🎮 How to Use
Type a task and click the “Add” button or press Enter.
Use “Move Up” and “Move Down” to reorder tasks.
Use “Delete Selected” to remove a task (with confirmation).
